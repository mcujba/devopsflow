Kubernetes has become the de facto standard for container orchestration. Whether you're managing a handful of microservices or scaling to thousands of pods, understanding the core concepts is essential for any DevOps engineer.

## Prerequisites

Before diving in, make sure you have the following tools installed:

```bash
# Install kubectl
curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
chmod +x kubectl && sudo mv kubectl /usr/local/bin/

# Verify installation
kubectl version --client
```

For a local development cluster, I recommend using **kind** (Kubernetes in Docker):

```bash
# Install kind
go install sigs.k8s.io/kind@latest

# Create a cluster
kind create cluster --name dev
```

## Core Concepts

Kubernetes revolves around a few key abstractions:

- **Pod** — the smallest deployable unit, wrapping one or more containers
- **Deployment** — declares the desired state for a set of pods
- **Service** — stable networking endpoint for accessing pods
- **Namespace** — logical isolation boundary within a cluster

## Your First Deployment

Let's deploy a simple nginx application. Create a file called `nginx-deployment.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: nginx:1.27-alpine
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
          resources:
            requests:
              cpu: "50m"
              memory: "64Mi"
            limits:
              cpu: "100m"
              memory: "128Mi"
```

Apply it to your cluster:

```bash
# Apply the manifest
kubectl apply -f nginx-deployment.yaml

# Watch the rollout
kubectl rollout status deployment/nginx

# Check running pods
kubectl get pods -l app=nginx
```

## Exposing the Service

To make nginx accessible, create a Service:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-svc
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 80
  type: ClusterIP
```

```bash
# Apply the service
kubectl apply -f nginx-svc.yaml

# Port-forward to access locally
kubectl port-forward svc/nginx-svc 8080:80
```

Now open `http://localhost:8080` and you should see the nginx welcome page.

## What's Next

This is just the beginning. In upcoming posts we'll cover:

- Helm charts for packaging applications
- Ingress controllers and TLS termination
- Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana
- GitOps workflows with ArgoCD

> The key to mastering Kubernetes is practice. Spin up a local cluster and experiment — break things, fix them, and build your intuition.

Happy deploying!

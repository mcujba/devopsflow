    "company_p1": "DevOpsFlow is the consulting and engineering arm of Skynet Hosting SRL, a Moldova-based IT company operating under the Moldova IT Park program. We hold our own Autonomous System (AS48296) and maintain direct relationships with upstream providers — because we don't just configure infrastructure, we understand it from the wire up.",
    "company_p2": "We partner with companies across the United States, Switzerland, and the European Union, delivering DevOps engineering, cloud architecture, and infrastructure automation.

    "founder_p1": "I started my career in 2012 at Moldtelecom's Network Operations Center, where I learned that every second of downtime costs more than any amount of prevention. That lesson stuck.",
    "founder_p2": "Over the next decade, I moved through increasingly complex environments — from managing Cisco and Juniper networks at Orange Moldova, to building containerized platforms at SaltEdge, to deploying Kubernetes clusters across hybrid clouds at EBS Integrator. Along the way, I picked up certifications not as résumé padding, but because each one solved a real problem I was facing at work.",
    "founder_p3": "Today, I serve as Senior DevOps Engineer for DuoCircle (San Diego, CA), where I manage production infrastructure handling millions of requests daily. In parallel, I run Skynet Hosting SRL, providing DevOps consulting and infrastructure services to companies that need senior-level expertise without the overhead of a full-time hire.",
    "founder_approach": "My approach is simple: understand the business problem first, then engineer the smallest solution that solves it reliably.",
